*set up initial files
*pseudo coded the pages that will be used
*got the first page welcome screen up
*timer is working now and so is the display none for the welcome screen. (pretty proud of this)
*got the questions to hide when the page loads. I plan on having them to call to display block when I start calling the questons.
*set the document query parameters for the html in js
*entire skeleton is set up for the main page.

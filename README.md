# API-CodeQuiz

I got super lost and have to go back and reveiew the entire week. I will sumbit what I have and hopefully can update it this weekend. Otherwise I will have to ask for a re-grade because I have hit a wall.

This is the toughest one yet. The event listener really gave me a hard time. I also struggled with the score, made it way harder than it needed to be. Once the items were stored into the local storage I was home free.
